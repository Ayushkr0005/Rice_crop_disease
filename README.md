# üåæ **Rice Leaf Disease Classifier: AI for Healthier Crops**

Welcome to the **Rice Leaf Disease Classifier**, a deep learning project designed to leverage the power of artificial intelligence for the early detection of rice leaf diseases. With the help of a custom **AlexNet** architecture, this project efficiently detects three common rice leaf diseases: **Bacterial Leaf Blight**, **Brown Spot**, and **Leaf Smut**. This AI-powered tool aims to support farmers by providing real-time disease prediction, ultimately contributing to healthier crops and improved food security.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Rice is a global staple crop, but its production is under constant threat from various diseases that can devastate yields. **Early detection** is key to mitigating these losses, and that‚Äôs where our project comes in. By utilizing **deep learning** and **computer vision**, this classifier can identify rice leaf diseases from images with remarkable accuracy, even with a small dataset of just 120 images.

The project features:
- A **custom CNN model** inspired by **AlexNet** with added **batch normalization** for stable training and improved convergence.
- Creative and effective **data augmentation techniques** to enhance model generalization.
- Robust **evaluation strategies**, including 5-fold cross-validation, to ensure the model‚Äôs reliability in real-world applications.
- Easy scalability for **mobile app deployment** and **IoT integration**, bringing AI-powered disease detection directly into the hands of farmers.

## üéØ **Why This Project?**
- **Real-World Impact**: This tool empowers farmers to identify and address rice diseases early, minimizing crop loss and improving food security.
- **Innovative Model**: The custom **AlexNet** architecture with batch normalization is tailored for small datasets, providing a unique approach to overcoming data limitations.
- **Scalable Design**: Not limited to rice, this model can be adapted to detect diseases in other crops, and has the potential to be deployed as a mobile app for easy access by farmers.
- **Educational Value**: Whether you're new to deep learning or experienced in computer vision, this project serves as a great learning resource with well-documented code and explanations.

## üåü **Key Features**
- **Custom AlexNet Architecture**: The CNN model is fine-tuned for rice disease detection, featuring batch normalization layers for faster convergence and better performance.
- **Creative Data Augmentation**: Implements random cropping, flipping, rotations, and color jittering to simulate real-world variations, such as lighting changes and leaf orientation.
- **Robust Evaluation**: Uses **5-fold cross-validation** to ensure reliable performance, providing an unbiased estimate of model accuracy and generalization ability.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays true vs. predicted labels for an intuitive understanding of model predictions, along with confusion matrices and ROC curves.
- **Mastering Small Datasets**: Overcomes the challenge of working with a small dataset (120 images) by leveraging augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning techniques.
- **Future-Ready**: Scalable for future integration with IoT devices or mobile applications for on-the-go rice disease predictions.
